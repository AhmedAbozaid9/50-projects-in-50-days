# 50-projects-in-50-days
this is a course that I bought from Udemy by [traversy media](https://github.com/bradtraversy). I wanted to gain more experience with JavaScript and CSS, and I really found this course a great opportunity for this. So I Inrolled it. I didn't copy a single code, and I made every project with a different code than the instructor used. and I also tried to add new features by my own, So I learned alot in the process
